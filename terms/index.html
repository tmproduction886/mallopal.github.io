    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">By downloading, installing, or using Mallo, you agree to these Terms. We may update them from time to time; continued use after changes means you accept the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>Agreement to terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Mallo app (“Mallo” or “Service”) from MalloPal (“we”, “our”, “us”), you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>Description of the service</h2>
    <p>Mallo is an AI companion app that provides conversation, memory, proactive check-ins, weekly recap, and related features. The Service is provided on an “as is” basis. We may change, suspend, or discontinue features with reasonable notice where practicable.</p>

    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the age of consent in your jurisdiction) to use Mallo. By using the Service, you represent that you meet this requirement and that you have the right to enter into these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Account and use</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for your use of the Service and for any content you provide. You agree not to use Mallo: (a) in violation of any law or third-party rights; (b) to harass, abuse, or harm others; (c) to attempt to reverse-engineer or compromise the Service; or (d) in any way that could damage or overburden our systems. We may suspend or terminate access for breach of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions and payments</h2>
    <p>Some features are offered through in-app subscriptions (e.g. via Apple). Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings. Refunds are subject to Apple’s policies.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>Mallo, MalloPal, and related logos and content are owned by us or our licensors. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Service for personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of the Service is also governed by our <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how we collect, use, and protect your information. By using Mallo, you consent to that processing.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
    <p class="disclaimer">THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. MALLO IS A COMPANION APP AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MENTAL HEALTH, MEDICAL, OR LEGAL ADVICE. IF YOU ARE IN CRISIS, PLEASE CONTACT A QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL OR EMERGENCY SERVICES.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM (OR ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS IF GREATER).</p>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless MalloPal and its affiliates from any claims, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Service or your breach of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Changes to terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes in the app or by other reasonable means. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>Governing law and disputes</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which we operate, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any dispute shall be resolved in the courts of that jurisdiction, except where prohibited.</p>
